* Build the wasm
The wasm file is built from [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] and [[https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org][milisims/tree-sitter-org]]

#+begin_src bash
# image: node:14
npm install --save-dev tree-sitter-cli@0.19.5 # the latest version has some erros when building the wasm
cd node_modules
git clone https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org
cd tree-sitter-org/
npm install
cd ../../
npx tree-sitter build-wasm node_modules/tree-sitter-org
#+end_src

the official =tree-sitter.wasm= has some problem with my newly build =tree-sitter-org.wasm=, so I built it again with

#+begin_src bash
# install emsdk
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk/
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# build tree-sitter
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter.git
cd tree-sitter
./script/build-wasm
# built wasm in the fold lib/binding_web/
#+end_src
